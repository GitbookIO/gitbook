## Contributing

### Make changes locally

Any contribution you make can be made to the code located in this repository. In order to contribute, you'll need to start off of a local version of this repository.

#### 1. Fork the repository

##### Using GitHub Desktop:

-   [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
-   Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

##### Using the command line:

-   [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

#### 2. Create a working branch and start with your changes

After forking this repository, you'll want to [create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) to work off of.

#### 3. Install dependencies and run the project locally

GitBook uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to run the project. Make sure you're using the specified version of `node` before running any of the development commands to ensure a smooth development experience.

You can easily do this by running the command `nvm use`.

To start your local version of GitBook, run the command `bun dev`.

#### 4. Preview your changes

When running the development server, published GitBook sites can be rendered through your local version at `http://localhost:3000/`.

For example, our published docs can be viewed using the local version by visiting `http://localhost:3000/docs.gitbook.com` after running the development server.

You can visit any published GitBook site behind your development server. Please make sure your site is [published publicly](https://docs.gitbook.com/published-documentation/publish-your-content-as-a-docs-site) to ensure you can view the site correctly in your development version.

### Commit your update

[Commit your changes](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages!

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review your code to double check that your chagnes are ready to be added.

### Pull Request

-   Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
-   Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
