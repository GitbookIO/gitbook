# 📅 Meetings

### ☕️ Zoom Coffee

We meet once a week for coffee for whoever is open and interested or whoever fancies a chat!

### 🎲 Team Event

As we don't want to wait for our next offsite to spend some quality time together and sparkle our days, we're trying to organise team events on a regular basis.

### 🤝 Weekly Syncs

We meet on a weekly basis and sync between our cycle teams and the company as a whole.

### 🌍 Offsites

Every few months we arrange a company offsite so we can all meet face to face.
