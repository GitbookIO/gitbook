# Glossary

You can specify all terms and their respective definitions to be displayed as annotations in `GLOSSARY.md`. Based on those terms, {{ book.GB }} will automatically build an index and highlight those terms in pages.

The `GLOSSARY.md` format is a list of `h2` headings, along with a description paragraph:

```markdown
## Term
Definition for this term

## Another term
With it's definition, this can contain bold text
and all other kinds of inline markup ...
```
